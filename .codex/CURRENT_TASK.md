P1c uses direct exact position DP under P0 legal support and P1a fixed-pass
scores, composed with P1b lazy spans. The streaming trainer now makes the piece
state authoritative, updates it transactionally between passes, retains
lexical counts as diagnostics, and exports the required exact scientific and
bounded inspection artifacts. Document-interruption resume and one/two-worker
scientific outputs are byte-identical. The focused pieces/latent suite passes
(`76 passed`) and the trainer full-repository gate passes (`633 passed, 2
warnings`). No production-shaped S1M2 benchmark or full-corpus S1M2 run has
started.

The historical deletion-readiness manifest remains provenance for the 12
files classified `SAFE_TO_DELETE_REGENERABLE`. A read-only path check now finds
all 12 absent after the separately researcher-authorized manual cleanup. Do
not recreate them, rerun their hashes, or delete anything else.

Do not rerun frozen S1M1 work or M0-prime generation/validation. `notes/**`
remains strictly local/read-only and must never be modified, created, moved,
copied, deleted, tracked, staged, restored, checked out, or force-added.

## Next task: detached frozen representative measurement

Optimization 7 is accepted with byte-identical science and a small 3.9%/1.1%
paired-probe wall reduction. Launch exactly one durable detached local attempt
that runs the frozen full representative workload sequentially for M0-prime
IAST continuous and M0 Devanagari continuous at four workers, one pass plus
final inspection, without `cProfile`. Record exact Git/config/input/run IDs,
logs, completion evidence, and overwrite refusal. Return immediately after
launch. Do not launch the stress workload concurrently, rerun the static scan,
or launch full-M0.
