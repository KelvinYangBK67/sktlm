## Current status

Branch: `exp/s1m2-reusable-pieces`.

```text
S1M1: FROZEN
researcher-authorized S1M1 regenerable-file cleanup: COMPLETE (12/12 absent)
M0-prime formal substrate: COMPLETE / VALID
S1M2 P0 reference oracle: COMPLETE
S1M2 P1a production scoring: COMPLETE
S1M2 P1b lazy candidates: COMPLETE
S1M2 P1c exact composed inference: COMPLETE
P1c/P0 and lazy/materialized equivalence gates: PASS
S1M2 streaming trainer integration: COMPLETE
resume and serial/parallel scientific equivalence: PASS
continuous profiling/benchmark freeze: READY TO START
```

P1c uses direct exact position DP under P0 legal support and P1a fixed-pass
scores, composed with P1b lazy spans. The streaming trainer now makes the piece
state authoritative, updates it transactionally between passes, retains
lexical counts as diagnostics, and exports the required exact scientific and
bounded inspection artifacts. Document-interruption resume and one/two-worker
scientific outputs are byte-identical. The focused pieces/latent suite passes
(`76 passed`) and the trainer full-repository gate passes (`633 passed, 2
warnings`). No production-shaped S1M2 benchmark or full-corpus S1M2 run has
started.

The historical deletion-readiness manifest remains provenance for the 12
files classified `SAFE_TO_DELETE_REGENERABLE`. A read-only path check now finds
all 12 absent after the separately researcher-authorized manual cleanup. Do
not recreate them, rerun their hashes, or delete anything else.

Do not rerun frozen S1M1 work or M0-prime generation/validation. `notes/**`
remains strictly local/read-only and must never be modified, created, moved,
copied, deleted, tracked, staged, restored, checked out, or force-added.

## Next task: continuous profiling and benchmark freeze

Inspect and extend continuous-specific telemetry without feeding it into
scientific decisions. Freeze deterministic representative and long-span stress
document lists from static representation properties before serious
optimization. Prepare character-, document-, and span/complexity-weighted
projection bases. Run only cheap checks inline; detach any static scan or
benchmark plausibly exceeding five minutes and record its exact SHA/config/run
identity before launch. Do not launch full-M0.
