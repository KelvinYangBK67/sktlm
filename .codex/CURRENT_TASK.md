P1c uses direct exact position DP under P0 legal support and P1a fixed-pass
scores, composed with P1b lazy spans. The streaming trainer now makes the piece
state authoritative, updates it transactionally between passes, retains
lexical counts as diagnostics, and exports the required exact scientific and
bounded inspection artifacts. Document-interruption resume and one/two-worker
scientific outputs are byte-identical. The focused pieces/latent suite passes
(`83 passed`) and the trainer full-repository gate passes (`633 passed, 2
warnings`). No full-corpus S1M2 run has started.

The historical deletion-readiness manifest remains provenance for the 12
files classified `SAFE_TO_DELETE_REGENERABLE`. A read-only path check now finds
all 12 absent after the separately researcher-authorized manual cleanup. Do
not recreate them, rerun their hashes, or delete anything else.

Do not rerun frozen S1M1 work or M0-prime generation/validation. `notes/**`
remains strictly local/read-only and must never be modified, created, moved,
copied, deleted, tracked, staged, restored, checked out, or force-added.

## Completed representative gate

Detached attempt `s1m2_continuous_representative_local_v1_attempt01` completed
at `765742a1037ff2e1ef5dc267d300742ad84ef0c8`; both stderr logs are empty and
all identities validate. It measured 2.882/2.876 hours for only one training
pass plus exact inspection. A reconstructed three-pass-plus-inspection sample
is 4.754/4.738 hours. Central phoneme-scaled full-corpus projections are
481/480 hours and conservative squared-span projections are 627/625 hours.
The exact frontends have identical span/state/transition work and byte-identical
piece inventory, lexical diagnostics, and rule usage.

Final output is 2.43/2.52 GB for this roughly one-percent workload, with
3.75/3.89 GB transient output. Simple phoneme scaling exceeds the 300 GiB host
for transient output, so storage is also not ready. The benchmark must not be
rerun. The stress and cloud scaling gates are deferred because they would only
measure the already-decisive bad structural regime.

## Next task: fixed cheap probe for optimization 8

Optimization 8 shares token-local form prefixes during training, then uses one
reverse adjoint pass to aggregate exact posterior-weighted piece counts. The
route is bounded at 262,144 prefix nodes, falls back exactly, and preserves all
scientific quantities against the legacy/P0 path under the accepted tolerance.
The pieces/latent suite passes (`87 passed`). Commit and push the coherent
candidate, then run the fixed paired two-line, one-worker, one-pass plus
inspection probe once at that clean SHA. Compare science, shared work counters,
wall time, and intended transition/cache mechanism against optimization 7.
Do not launch the representative, stress, cloud, or full-M0 workloads.
